      This year marks the 50<span class="s1"><sup>th</sup></span> anniversary of
      National Volunteer Week, which has helped recognize and amplify the impact
      of volunteer service and the power of volunteers to build stronger
      communities, tackle society’s greatest challenges, and transform the
      world.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
      At <strong>Public Consulting Group</strong> (PCG), we empower our
      employees to volunteer their time and efforts to support the communities
      we serve. Through the PCG Cares program, employees can dedicate up to 32
      hours of paid volunteer time each year toward causes and organizations
      that matter to them.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">
      To celebrate the last 50 years of community service impact, PCG is shining
      a light on the people and causes that inspire us to serve. As an
      organization dedicated to creating solutions that matter, we recognize and
      thank the employees who continuously lend their time and voice to make a
      difference in their communities. Read their stories below.

        Ronald McDonald Houses provide families with a home-like place to stay
        as their child receives medical care. Located directly across from
        Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, Ronald McDonald House
        of Central Ohio helps facilitate family-centered care that fosters
        health and wellbeing for the whole family. PCG’s Quality Assurance team
        in Ohio has volunteered with Ronald McDonald House twice, the first time
        by making lunch for residents and most recently by making welcome
        blankets. In 2024, the team made 11 blankets, which welcomed new
        families and provided comfort to their children. <br />
        <br />
        “While our team has fortunately never had to use the services of Ronald
        McDonald House, we have witnessed how this organization provides
        families with stability amidst unthinkable circumstances. Volunteering
        has helped us develop empathy, patience, and stronger communication
        skills. Being part of a team dedicated to making a difference has taught
        me the value of collaboration and service.”

        PCG’s Sacramento office has focused their volunteer activities on
        reducing food insecurity in Sacramento County, where over 448,000 people
        are living 200 percent below the Federal Poverty Level and more than 25
        percent are at risk of food insecurity. The team began volunteering with
        the Sacramento Food Bank and Family Services in 2019, preparing and
        packing food for the homeless and hosting food drives.<br />
        <br />
        “It is a privilege to help the community, and I am very proud to work
        for a company that supports such work. PCG Cares provides such wonderful
        opportunities to meet like-minded PCG colleagues and spend an afternoon
        away from the computer while still working together to deliver something
        tangibly positive to the community. I always end a PCG Cares event with
        a full heart and appreciation for those that fully dedicate themselves
        to this type of work.”

      <p style="padding-top: 8px">
        One of the first places Pam volunteered after relocating from Charlotte
        to Boston was Shattuck Shelter, later known as hopeFound, which
        eventually merged with Pine Street Inn, the largest provider of homeless
        services in New England. Pam and other PCG employees became regular
        volunteers at hopeFound’s employment center, helping individuals with
        career preparation. The time Pam spent working with people experiencing
        homelessness changed both her life and career. In 2017, Pam launched PCG
        Cares, a program created to allow employees the opportunity to support
        their communities and connect with colleagues from across the firm.
        Since its inception, PCG employees have volunteered over 25,000 hours.

        “A great majority of the work we do at PCG is helping government
        agencies better serve the public. When we volunteer, many of the people
        we serve benefit from the work we do every day. When we can see and
        interact with the people who are directly impacted by the work we do for
        our clients, it gives new meaning to everything we do. Volunteering in
        the community where you live, helping your neighbors, and setting an
        example of caring for everyone around you makes the world a better
        place.”

        The American Red Cross provides emergency assistance, disaster relief,

        journey with the American Red Cross began in 2020 during the COVID-19
        pandemic, which threatened blood supplies throughout the country. Having
        witnessed the life-saving impact of blood donations in emergency medical
        situations, Richard decided to serve as a Blood Donor Ambassador,
        alleviating administrative burdens for medical staff so that they could
        focus on collecting donations more efficiently.<br />

        it. Volunteering has not only allowed me to give back to my community

        For many years, PCG’s Phoenix team has volunteered with The Salvation
        Army Laura Danieli Activities Center, which provides year-round programs
        to support low-income communities. For Robert, the holiday meal shifts,
        which provide a full-service dining experience for seniors during the
        holiday season, have been particularly memorable and meaningful. The
        seniors they serve often have limited incomes with few loved ones
        nearby, and many are veterans who dedicated their lives to serving
        others.<br />
        <br />“I’ve always believed that at some point, everyone faces hardship.
        I’ve been fortunate to have support from family and friends during my
        tough times, but I recognize that many people don’t have that safety
        net. That’s why I give back whenever I can—because one day, I might need
        someone to do the same for me. Being able to do this through PCG, an
        organization that values and supports community engagement, makes me
        proud to be part of the team.”
