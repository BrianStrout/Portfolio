    step-by-step guide to help small businesses leverage social media
    effectively. ### 1. Choose the Right Platforms Not every social media

    and compelling captions to attract engagement. ### 5. Interact With Your
    Audience Respond to comments, messages, and mentions promptly. Engaging with
    your audience builds trust and encourages more interaction. ### 6. Use
    Hashtags Strategically Hashtags help improve your content’s visibility.

    media insights to see what works best. Adjust your strategy based on
